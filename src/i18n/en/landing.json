	"common-first-question": "What types of goals can I track using this website?",
	"common-first-question-answer": "GoalTracker may offer different categories for different types of goals, or you may be able to customize your goal categories to fit your specific needs. Ultimately, the types of goals you can track using the app are limited only by your own imagination and ambition.",

	"common-second-question-answer": "Goal Tracker has the ability to create team goals, which means you can track your goals with a friend or family member by inviting them to join your team.",
	"common-third-question": "What happens if I don't achieve my goal by the deadline?",
	"common-third-question-answer": "If you do not achieve your goal by the deadline set in GoalTracker, the app may simply mark the goal as 'missed' or 'incomplete'. It is important to remember that not achieving a goal by a specific deadline does not necessarily mean you have failed. You can still work towards your goal and make progress, even if it takes longer than you initially anticipated. In fact, many goals require ongoing effort and may take longer than expected to achieve.",
	"common-fourth-question": "How often should I update my progress on my goals?",
	"common-fourth-question-answer": "The frequency with which you update your progress on your goals may depend on various factors, such as the nature of your goals, the level of detail you want to track, and your personal preferences. As a general guideline, it is a good idea to update your progress on your goals regularly, such as daily or weekly. This can help you stay motivated, identify any obstacles or challenges you are facing, and adjust your approach as needed.",
	"common-fifth-question": "Is my information secure on this website?",
	"common-fifth-question-answer": "Of course, to sure if your information is secure on GoalTracker, you can look for indicators such as a secure connection (HTTPS), a privacy policy that explains how user data is collected and used, and any security certifications or third-party audits that the web-app may have undergone.",
